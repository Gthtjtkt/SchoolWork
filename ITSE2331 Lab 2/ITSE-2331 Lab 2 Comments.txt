Overall, i found this lab to be more difficult than the last one, but not too much more.
The second hardest thing was getting the compareArrays function working properly
the hardest was definitely the sortArrays function, since i had to make a template class for it.
I had other problems with the sortArrays function, since the way that i was formatting them was accidentally changing how they were sorted
